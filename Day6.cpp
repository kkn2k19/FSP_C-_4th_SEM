//STL (standard tag linrary)

 - In C++, STL provide powerful collection of classes and functions of general purpose data structures and algorithms.

it include 4 types of method : 

 - Container : 
*        Vector : dynamic array that grow and shrink at runtime.
*        List : A doubly linked list
*        Map : An associated container that store data in key-value pair.
*        Set : It contains distinct elements or unique element 
{1,2,3,1,2,3}={1,2,3}
*        Stack : LIFO
*        Queue : FIFO

 - Algorithms : 
          sorting : sort in ascending and descending order
          T : O(logn)   S : O(1)

          Searching : Linear and == Binary
                      - upper and lower bound

          max(), min(), accumulate(), find() etc

 - Iterators : 
          - Forward iterator : forward traversal
          - Bidirection : backward and forward traversal
          - Random access : direct access on element

 - Functors : Functors are object like function.
              for creating custom algorithms.
